Please, run Install_OpenVPN_EasyRSA.py script with Sudo.

This should be enough to set your server listenning on 1194.

- Ensure with you Internet Provider to redirect this traffic to this port and set a staticl LAN Ipv4 for the server. 
- Im trying to figure out how reflect the real IP out of CGNAT to use NoIP, i was not able to complete this task yet.
- MTU was set by default. Ensure to adjust the better MTU for the server and Client, run a Iperf3 (I pretend to automate this).
- Adjust your interface on wakeup_VPN_config.sh
- The OVPN File will be generated in the same Path of ./Scripts folder.
